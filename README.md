## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivamprasad1001/face-detection.git
   cd face-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Detecting Faces in Images

```bash
python detect_faces_image.py --image path_to_image.jpg
```

### Real-time Face Detection via Webcam

```bash
python detect_faces_video.py
```

### Arguments

- `--image`: Path to the input image file.
- `--video`: Path to the input video file. If not provided, the webcam stream is used by default.

## Configuration

- **Confidence Threshold:** Adjust the minimum probability to filter weak detections. This can be set within the script files.

- **Model Selection:** Switch between different pre-trained models based on accuracy and performance requirements.
